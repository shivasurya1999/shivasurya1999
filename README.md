Hello and welcome to my repository! My name is Shiva Surya, and I have recently graduated with an MS in Robotics from WPI. During my master's, I engaged in a variety of projects including robotic ultrasound SLAM, developing the perception and planning stack for aerial vehicles, IMU state estimation, mobile robot path planning, autonomous vehicle motion prediction, and manipulator grasp detection. I completed my internship at Deka Research, where I focused on mobile robot localization by implementing Direct Visual Inertial Odometry.

Through these experiences, I have developed a diverse set of skills, preparing me to tackle complex real-world robotics problems. I view learning as a lifelong journey and continue to expand my understanding of the world through intellectually stimulating projects and discussions.

Before pursuing my master's, I worked as a Component Development Engineer for automotive wiring harnesses at Bajaj Auto Limited. During my undergraduate studies at NIT Rourkela, I was part of Team Roadrunner, the Formula Student team, where I contributed to the Chassis and Brakes department in my sophomore and junior years.
