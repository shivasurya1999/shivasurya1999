Hello! My name is Shiva Surya, and I'm a Robotics Master's student at WPI. I recently completed my internship at Deka Research, where I worked on robot localization by implementing Direct Visual Inertial Odometry. I've also designed algorithms for Multi-Agent Path Finding using Conflict-Based Search, object grasping using parallel jaw gripper, and developed a novel deep-learning framework to predict agent motion around autonomous vehicles.

I'm passionate about solving complex problems and am looking for opportunities to apply my multidisciplinary skills in a dynamic team. I'd love to discuss how I can contribute to your organization. 

Before starting my master's, I worked as a Component Development engineer of automotive wiring harnesses at Bajaj Auto Limited. During my bachelor's, I worked in Team Roadrunner, the Formula Student team of NIT Rourkela in the Chassis and Brakes department in my sophomore and junior years of college.
